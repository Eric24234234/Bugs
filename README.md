Here I've done some testing with bugs

**Broken layout on Facebook Market**

**Description**
The facebook marketplace page should have the items arranged and spaced so that is easy to
browse. This doesn’t happen as no spacing is present around the images and the text is broken
too.

..........................


**Steps to reproduce**
1. Login to facebook
2. Go to Marketplace


**Expected result**
All items in the Marketplace should have proper spacing between them.


**Actual result**

Items in the Marketplace page don’t have spacing and the text is broken.
Duplicated information for upload multiple pages for invoice


**Steps to reproduce**

2. Scroll to see the upload invoice part of the form


**Expected result**
Information should not be duplicated on site.


**Actual result**
The info about uploading additional pages appears twice on page.
Additional info: on mockup the info under the button is not shown,=.
